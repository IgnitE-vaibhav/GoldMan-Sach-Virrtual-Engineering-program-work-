OVERVIEW:

As a governance analyst it is part of your duties to assess the level of protection offered by implemented controls and minimize the probability of a successful breach. To be successful at your job you often need to know the techniques used by hackers to circumvent implemented controls and propose uplifts to increase the overall level of security in an organization. Gaining valid credentials gives the attackers access to the organization’s IT system, thus circumventing most of perimeter controls in place.

TASK:

Crack leaked password database
Analyze results and propose uplifts to controls and policies

QUESTIONS TO BE WORKED UPON:

You must determine the following:

What type of hashing algorithm was used to protect passwords?
What level of protection does the mechanism offer for passwords?
What controls could be implemented to make cracking much harder for the hacker in the event of a password database leaking again?
What can you tell about the organization’s password policy (e.g. password length, key space, etc.)?
What would you change in the password policy to make breaking the passwords harder? 

Try to crack the passwords provided in the 'password dump' file using available tools like hashcat.

RESULT : 
When the task was performed , I got to know that the passwords were encrypted by outdated MD5 hash algorithm which  provides a very weak protection.

The solutions provided to the organisation and the cracked passwords are mentioned in the draft file.
